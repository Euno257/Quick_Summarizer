Once upon a time . . . a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together.

 Their ruler was a wise old lion.

But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be
their new ruler.

 The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head
it fitted.

 Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears.

The fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals.

 Then a cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks.

First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground.

 Then he tossed it higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down.
